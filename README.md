### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:fire: My last open source project is [Dataset-Fixer](https://github.com/t0efL/Dataset-Fixer)
(A utility for sorting, filtering, and transformation of datasets).

:dart: I'm currently studying linear algebra for ML/DL in a simple course and improving my skills in working with big data and its processing and visualization. I'm currently studying C++ on coursera as well.

:ballot_box_with_check: I'm currently participating at [Cornell Birdcall Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition), [Google Landmark Recognition 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-2020), and [OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression](https://www.kaggle.com/c/osic-pulmonary-fibrosis-progression/overview) Kaggle competitions.
